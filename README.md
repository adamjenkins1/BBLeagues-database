#BBLeagues Database Final Project

<p>Using Oracle and SQL, we were able to construct a database of NBA player and team statistics. Afterwards, using a combination of Spool and PL/SQL, we were able to create our own .csv files from the master .csv file so they could be easily plotted using R and RStudio in order to better interpret the data. Be sure to check out the full presentation for more information!</p>
